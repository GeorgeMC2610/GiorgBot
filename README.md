# GiorgBot

A simple bot written in Python 3 using the <a href="https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">discord.py</a> API.

## What does it do?

This is my personal bot written in Python 3. It acts like a **robot administrator** or **assistant moderator** to my personal server. A lot ot features are added just for fun or as a challenge, to test my skills in programming.

## What capabilities does it have?

This bot is capable of many things. The most important functions to add were mostly things that had to be done automatically. But, in general:

### Removing unwanted messages

In the server there are several channels, called "libraries", where no text messages are allowed. As soon as a text message appears in any of those channels, the bot immediately removes it. The user that sent the messages gets informed about this (locally, not with a DM) with a "funny" message.
